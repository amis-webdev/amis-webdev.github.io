    bio: Software engineer with an interest in amazing and performant UI's, distributed systems and robotics. Graduated with a masters degree in Computer Science and Engineering, focusing on Information Security Technology (i.e. a lot of mathematics, cryptographic algorithms and protocols, secure coding and such). I focus on web application development, using the latest front-end technologies, e.g. WebComponents/Polymer, AngularJS, etc. Because of AMIS's long history with Oracle technology (almost exclusively), my speciality has become creating user-friendly interfaces on top of complex enterprise systems.
